During the measurements, the spot heater was attached to the external ground insulation of one of the four coils of the magnet. The heater contact area of 4~$\text{mm}^2$ was centered at the \nth{13} layer on the aperture side of the magnet, as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:spot_heater_placement}.

The coil is quenched by the heat generated in the spot-heater. The heat is a~result of a~current discharge in the~\nth{1} order RC-circuit as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spot_heater_capacitor_discharge}. The results from the measurements include the capacitance of $C=14~\text{mF}$ and the voltage accross the capacitor over time.

The spot heater resistance is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    R_\text{spot heater} = \frac{\tau}{C},
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ -- time constant, $C$ -- capacitance. The electric energy of the capacitor is directly dissipated in the spot-heater. Therefore, the power dissipation at the spot heater is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    P(t)_\text{spot heater} = -P(t)_\text{capacitor} = -\frac{1}{\text{dt}} (E_\text{C}) = -\frac{1}{\text{dt}} (\frac{1}{2} \text{C}V_\text{C}^2),
    \label{eqn:power_dissipation}
\end{equation}
where $V_\text{C}$ -- voltage across the capacitor, $E_\text{C}$ -- energy stored in the capacitor, $P(t)$ -- power being a function of time. Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_discharge} presents the measured drop of a~capacitive voltage while the capacitor was discharging. Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_discharge} also presents the~deduced power dissipation at the~spot heater based on~(\ref{eqn:power_dissipation}). The sampling frequency of the measurements was equal to $f=5000~\text{Hz}$. Based on the power curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:capacitor_discharge}, most of energy was transmitted to the coil during the first $t=5~\text{ms}$ and the capacitor was fully discharged at $t=10~\text{ms}$. The coil's bath temperature was $T_0=4.3~\text{K}$ during the measurements.

With the voltage drop shape, the time constant and spot heater resistance were deduced, as shown in Table~\ref{table:rc_circuit_characteristics}. Moreover, the entire capacitive energy deposited in the~magnet was approximately equal to $E_\text{C}=2.5~\text{J}$.

The electrical circuit schematic of the skew quadrupole is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_electrical_scheme}. Each coil is characterised by the same self-inductance $L_\text{coil}$. Since all coils are connected in series, it is possible to include their mutual inductance in the self-inductance. The heat was not transmitted to other coils of the skew quadrupole during the measurements, i.e. only one coil out of four quenched. $R_\text{coil}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_electrical_scheme} represents the internal resistance of the coil where the spot heater was placed. When the skew quadrupole is in the superconducting state, $R_\text{coil}=0$. After the quench is provoked by depositing heat through the spot heater, $R_\text{coil}$ represented by a varying resistance starts to increase. In order to detect a quench, the voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ are compared. If their difference exceeds a threshold value, $V_\text{th}=0.2~\text{V}$ during a certain period of time, the quench is detected. The time, after which the quench is detected after exceeding the threshold $V_\text{th}$, is referred to as the validation time, and equals $t_\text{validation}=0.20~\text{ms}$. When the quench is detected, the switch $\text{s}_\text{power}$ closes and cuts off the power converter whereas the switch $\text{s}_\text{dump}$ opens leading to the discharge of the energy stored in the circuit in the dump resistor $R_\text{dump}$. The schematic in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_electrical_scheme} neither includes the protection devices of the energy extraction system nor those of the power converter as they do not affect the quench protection study in this thesis.

After the quench is detected, the circuit is represented, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_discharge_electrical_scheme}. The total magnet inductance $L_\text{magnet}$ is calculated as~\cite{marco_prioli_mails}
\begin{equation}
    L_\text{magnet} = 4 L_\text{coil} + 8 M_\text{a} + 4 M_\text{b},
\end{equation}
where $M_\text{a}$ -- mutual inductance between adjacent coils, $M_\text{b}$ -- mutual inductance between opposite coils. The initial discharge current $I_0$ is equal to the operating current of the magnet during the measurements. If the magnet is self-protected, $R_\text{dump}=0$. The dump resistance of the energy extraction system equals $R_\text{dump}=1.557$~\textOmega~\cite{marco_prioli_mails}.

The quench measurements were conducted for $I=86~\text{A}$, which is a lower value than the designed nominal operating current of the skew quadrupole. As presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_discharge_before_quench_detection}, the quench resistive voltage reaches the threshold value for the quench detection system at $t=130~\text{ms}$. The quench is detected at $t=150~\text{ms}$.~\cite{marco_prioli_mails}

Figure~\ref{fig:skew_quad_discharge} presents the current profile as well as the change of resistive voltage across the~magnet during the discharge of the skew quadrupole. The resistive voltage $V_\text{res}$ is a function of coil resistance $R_\text{coil}$ and the value of current in the circuit. Until $t=1.5~\text{s}$, a rise of voltage up to approximately 16~V is observed due to the increase of coil resistance, mainly because of a turn-to-turn propagation. After this time, the voltage drops down because the~current decreases rapidly in the circuit. The smooth shape of the current curve indicates that the quench back did not occur during the discharge which can be explained by a~relatively long discharge time. The quench measurements ended at $t=9~\text{s}$.
