Most of the data about the skew quadrupole was presented in Section~\ref{section: 1d_quench_propagation_geometry}. Unlike in 1D analyses presented in previous chapters, when a 3D thermal simulation of a magnet is considered, it is important to specify its winding scheme because the windings interact with each other thermally across the insulation layer. Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_transversal_cross_section} shows the transversal cross-section of one coil of the skew quadrupole. The windings are enclosed within an area of 24.5x27.3~mm. Moreover, each coil is covered with a 1 mm-thick ground insulation layer apart from the insulation between each winding described in Section~\ref{section: 1d_quench_propagation_geometry}. The ground insulation on the internal side of the coil is thinner and equal to 0.15~mm.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:winding_arrangement_cross_section}, each coil has 29 turns in each of its 26 layers. In total, the number of windings per coil is 754~\cite{marco_prioli_mails, hl_lhc_tech_design_report_v01}.

The winding scheme is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:winding_scheme_cross_section}. The winding~1 is placed at the bottom left of the 2D cross-section. The last winding number 754 is placed further in the \textit{x}-direction. The \nth{2} half of the coil is a~mirror reflection of the presented winding scheme.

The general parameters of the skew quadrupole are summarised in Table~\ref{table:skew_quad_params_table}. In the given magnet, there is only one aperture in which a particle beam travels through. Four coils of the magnet are connected in series and powered by a single power converter. It is interesting to mention that the coil length of only one coil is more than 800~m which is a very large number for thermal quench simulations, as mentioned in Section~\ref{section: 1D_quench_propagation_conclusions}. The operating current of the skew quadrupole is $I=182~\text{A}$.
