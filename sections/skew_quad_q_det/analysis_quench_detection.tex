Until the quench is detected, the current inside the magnet is constant and equal to $I=86~\text{A}$. Therefore, the magnetic field inside the magnet does not vary in time. The analysis of steady-state magnetic field in the middle of the magnet for this value of current was conducted at INFN-Milano in OPERA software \cite{samuele_mariotto_mails}. A 2D interpolation had to be conducted in order to fit the OPERA mesh with the windings' position. For each winding, it is assumed that it is subjected to the magnetic field from the centre of its cross-section estimated by the interpolation map presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Quad_Mag_contour1}.
