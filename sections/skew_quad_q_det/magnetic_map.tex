\subsection{Material Properties and Geometry}

Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_geometry_ansys} presents the cross-section of the skew quadrupole used for a magnetic analysis with the iron yoke  marked in red and the coil in blue. The~violet part of the~cross-section is considered to be air. The~magnet cross-section has three axes of symmetry. Therefore, only the \nth{8} part of the skew quadrupole is simulated.

The~coil cross-section is homogenised magnetically and electrically, i.e. there is no distinction between the insulation and the strand composite. In the magnetic analysis of the~skew quadrupole, it is assumed that the magnet is infinitely long. This assumption allows for considering this case as a plane 2D problem. The areas considered as the air and the~coil are characterised by the magnetic relative permeability equal to one. The magnetic properties of iron yoke are described with a~non-linear B-H curve, as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:b_h_curve}.

\subsection{Mesh, Initial and Boundary Conditions}

The meshed geometry is illustrated in Fig~\ref{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_mesh_ansys}. The element PLANE233 is used for the analysis. It is a 2-D element which has an ability to simulate 2D planar and axisymmetric magnetic fields. The element is defined by 8 nodes~\cite{ansys_element_manual}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]

    \draw[scale=1] (-3.5,1-1) circle (0.1cm);
    \draw[black, ->, scale=1] (-3.5,1-1) -- (-3.5,1.5-1);
    \draw[black, ->, scale=1] (-3.5,1-1) -- (-3,1-1);
    \node[scale = 0.8] at (-3.75,0.8-1) {$\vec{z}$};
    \node[scale = 0.8] at (-2.9,1.2-1) {$\vec{x}$};
    \node[scale = 0.8] at (-3.7,1.65-1) {$\vec{y}$};
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The \nth{8} part of the skew quadrupole cross-section.}
    \label{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_mesh_ansys}
\end{figure}

For the requirements of the given analysis, only one degree of freedom is used -- a~magnetic vector potential $A_\text{z}$. In order to take into consideration the symmetry condition, the~magnetic vector potential $A_\text{z}$ was set to zero on the left side of the of geometry. It means that the directional magnetic field $B_\text{x}$ is equal to zero on the left side marked in red. On the \nth{2} wall of symmetry, it is assumed by default in ANSYS APDL that the magnetic flux is perpendicular to the wall.

As illustrated in Fig~\ref{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_mesh_ansys}, the mesh was refined inside of the coil. There were 40 elements placed on each side of a rectangular coil. Then, the mesh was relaxed as a function of a~distance from the coil. In Table~\ref{table:mesh_characteristics_magnetic_ansys} the element size in the remaining
areas of the geometry is specified.

In the analysis, an equal current density was applied to the coil area. The current density was calculated as
\begin{equation}
    J_\text{coil} = \frac{n_\text{windings}~I}{A_\text{coil}},
\end{equation}
where $n_\text{windings}$ -- number of windings, $I$ -- current in each winding, $A_\text{coil}$ -- cross-sectional area of the coil with the resin and insulation. 86 static analyses were conducted with the~current linearly rising from 1 up to 86 amps. 

\subsection{Results and Magnetic Field Mapping in the Skew Quadrupole}

The magnetic field distribution in the iron yoke and the coil for two values of current is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_results_geometry_ansys}. With higher values of current, the magnetic field increases. One can also observe the influence of non-linear magnetic properties of the iron yoke. At different current levels, the magnetic field distribution is different.

    \label{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_results_geometry_ansys}
\end{figure}

As presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_results_coil_ansys}, the magnetic field also increases in the coil with rise of current. In order to use the results for the quench velocity modelling, the magnetic field at corner nodes of the coil elements was extracted. A linear interpolation was conducted for three parameters: \textit{x-}~and~\textit{y-}direction, and current.

    \label{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_results_coil_ansys}
\end{figure}

As presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:skew_quad_magnetic_interpolation_coil_ansys}, an $(x,y)$-position was used for a centre of each winding. As the magnet discharges in time, the magnetic field of each winding varies differently based on their position in space.
