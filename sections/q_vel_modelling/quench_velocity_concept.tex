When quench propagates, the point at which the cable transforms from superconducting to normal state moves forward with time, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:quench_front_propagation_illustration}. This point remains at critical temperature, $T_\text{c}$ for a given magnetic field strength. Its rate of position change in time is described as quench velocity. Depending on electro-magneto-thermal conditions at which quench occurs, quench velocity can remain constant or change in time.

Quench velocity can be approximated with analytic formulas. They are usually a function of current density, material properties of the winding and temperature gradient around the quench front. The quench velocity in ITER applications is mainly estimated based on~\cite{MIT_phd_thesis}. For superconducting accelerator magnets, Wilson's formula is more applicable if cooling with helium is not considered \cite[p.~206]{wilson1987superconducting}, as described below
\begin{equation}
    v_\text{quench}=\frac{J}{\gamma C}\sqrt{\frac{\rho k}{T_\text{s}-T_\text{0}}},
    \label{eqn:Wilson_quench_velocity_formula}
\end{equation}
where $T_\text{s}$ -- critical temperature,
$T_\text{0}$ -- coolant temperature,
$\rho$ -- electrical resistivity averaged over the conductor volume,
$J$ -- current density averaged over the conductor volume,
$k$ -- thermal conductivity averaged over the conductor unit cell,
$C$ -- volumetric heat capacity averaged over the conductor unit cell,
$\gamma$ -- conductor density.
