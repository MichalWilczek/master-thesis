In order to distinguish a quenched zone from a non-quenched one, the superconducting cable is divided into two domains as presented in Fig. \ref{fig:ansys_material_assignment}. The non-quenched part is characterised by nearly zero-resistivity (not zero for the sake of numerical stability) whereas the quenched cable has nonlinear resistivity of a strand composite as described in (\ref{eqn:strand_resistivity})~\cite{simon_mcintosh_private_communication}. The nonlinear resistivity is reassigned as the quench propagates in the numerical model.

\end{figure}

The reassignment of material properties is handled by an external routine which controls the quench propagation in time. In this case, a thermal model (solved by the numerical model) and quench velocity estimator (calculated by the external routine) are co-simulated. This problem can be resolved by means of: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item one-directional exchange of signals;
    \item bi-directional exchange of signals.
\end{enumerate}

The one-directional exchange of signals is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:unidirectional_coupling_scheme}. In this case, the numerical solver is provided with a quench front position from the previous communication point $t_{j-1}$ and calculates the temperature distribution in the current communication point~$t_j$. The parameter denoted as $x_{j-1}$ represents the information about the value of the next communication point $t_j$ and the quench front position in the cable. The external routine assumes a constant quench velocity independent of current and magnetic field strength. Therefore, the routine is not updated.

The bi-directional exchange of signals is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:bidirectional_coupling_scheme}.
Additionally to the one-directional case, the external routine is updated with the value of current and magnetic field strength from the numerical solver denoted as $y_j$ at communication point $t_j$ to estimate the quench velocity at $t_{j-1}$.

In both cases, the initial quench length is assumed at the beginning of the co-simulation. Between the time steps of the external routine, the numerical solver handles the problem with an adaptive time step smaller than the communication points $t_j$.

Provided that the data exchange between an external routine and a numerical solver occurs at communication times $t_j$, the quench velocity assignment algorithm is solved as described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:weak_coupling}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{Quench velocity assignment algorithm.}
  \label{alg:weak_coupling}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE assume initial quench position $x_{j-1}$ 
    \STATE \textbf{for} $j=1,2,...,N$ \textbf{do}
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} solve temperature distribution at time $t_j$
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} send solver results $y_{j}$ to external routine time $t_{j-1}$ (only for a bi-directional case)
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} calculate new quench position $x_{j}$ for a quench front
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} assign quench position $x_{j}$ to new nodes for solver time  $t_j$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

To sum up, the quench velocity assignment algorithm only requires a one-directional exchange of signals at fixed current and magnetic field strength. If the quench simulation is conducted at varying values of current and/or magnetic field, the bi-directional exchange of signals must be implemented. In this thesis, the quench velocity is estimated numerically. In the following chapters, the communication times $t_j$ between ANSYS and the external routine are described as $t_\text{com}$.
