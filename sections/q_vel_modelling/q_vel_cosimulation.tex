This part of the section describes how the quench velocity method is applied in a numerical solver. In order to distinguish the quenched zone from the non-quenched one, the superconducting cable is divided into two domains as presented in Fig. \ref{fig:ansys_material_assignment}. The non-quenched part is characterised by nearly zero-resistivity (not zero for the sake of numerical stability) whereas the quenched cable has non-linear resistivity properties of the strand composite as described in (\ref{eqn:strand_resistivity}). The non-linear resistivity is reassigned at each time step as the quench propagates in the model of a numerical solver.

The reassignment of material properties should be handled by an external routine which controls the propagation of quench in time. In this case, one should deal with a co-simulation of a numerical solver and a quench velocity estimator. This problem can be handled by means of: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item one-directional exchange of signals,
    \item bi-directional exchange of signals.
\end{itemize}

As already mentioned, the quench velocity can be: $(i)$ based on available measurements, $(ii)$ calculated numerically, $(iii)$ calculated analytically according to quench velocity equations available in literature. The first 2 above-mentioned methods to calculate quench velocity would require one-directional exchange of signals. If quench velocity is estimated analytically, one can choose between the one-directional and bi-directional case depending on whether the formula to calculate quench velocity requires input data from the solver, e.g. an updated material properties repository or the value of current.

The one-directional exchange of signals is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:unidirectional_coupling_scheme}. In this case, the numerical solver is provided with a quench front position from the previous communication point $T_{j-1}$ and calculates temperature distribution in the current communication point $T_j$.

The bi-directional exchange of signals is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:bidirectional_coupling_scheme}. In this case, the external routine is provided with the data from the numerical solver at point $T_j$ to estimate quench velocity at point $T_{j-1}$ up to the point $T_j$. The line which describes the information direction is marked in red in Fig.~\ref{fig:bidirectional_coupling_scheme}.

In both cases, the initial quench length is assumed at the beginning of the co-simulation. Between the time steps of the external routine, the numerical solver can handle the problem with an adaptive time step smaller than the communication points $T_j$.

Regardless the type of exchange of signals used, provided that data exchange between an external routine and a numerical solver occurs at communication times $T_j$, the quench velocity algorithm is solved as described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:weak_coupling}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Weak Coupling between a numerical solver and quench velocity estimator.}
  \label{alg:weak_coupling}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \STATE assume initial quench position $x_{1,j-1}$ 
    \STATE \textbf{for} $j=1,2,...,N$ \textbf{do}
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} solve temperature distribution at time $T_j$
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} send solver results $x_{2,j}$ to external routine time $T_{j-1}$ (only for bi-directional case)
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} estimate new quench position $x_{1,j}$ for a quench front
    \STATE \hspace{0.5cm} assign quench position $x_{1,j}$ to new nodes for solver time  $T_j$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In this thesis, the quench velocity is estimated numerically based on a one-directional exchange of signals.
