When a nonlinear situation is encountered in solving the heat conduction equation, the problem of this kind is handled by means of iteration. It means that the problem is linearised and the solver searches for the temperature distribution over the domain until the change of temperature between the steps will converge to a desirably low value. Due to high material non-linearities at cryogenic temperatures, in order to accurately solve the temperature distribution in the entire region of the cable, one should refine mesh and/or decrease the simulation time step (up to the order of a $\upmu$s).

Fig. \ref{fig:modelling_approach} presents an approximated temperature distribution over a discretised 1D thermal domain. The quenched and non-quenched regions in a superconducting cable have different but relatively uniform temperature distributions except for the regions close to the quench front. Therefore, the mesh density relatively far from the quench front can be relaxed due to the lower temperature difference between the nodes.

The idea of a quench velocity modelling is based on calculating/imposing quench velocity by an outsourced external routine. Such an approach allows one to have the quench wave implicitly solved. An accurate solution at the quench front is not required and the temperature in this region is approximated, knowing that it is placed between two extreme temperatures (either inside or outside of the quenched zone). As a result, the mesh refinement along the coil length is not needed anymore and the numerical model of smaller size is solved. To sum up, the numerical model still calculates the heat balance equation but with a fixed and relatively coarse mesh along the coil. Solving the quench propagation by means of a quench velocity method assumes that, while  simulating the heat propagation during a quench, the quench front velocity is known and estimated separately beforehand.
