In this section, the 1D coil is studied with an insulation layer together with the epoxy resin. Therefore, the~cross-sectional area of the considered geometry consists of a strand, insulation and epoxy resin marked in yellow, red and blue, respectively; see Fig.~\ref{fig: 1d_strand_geometry}. The length of the considered domain is $L_\text{strand}=1~\text{m}$.
