In this section, the 1D coil is analysed with an external insulation layer. Therefore, the winding cross-section consists of a strand marked in yellow in Fig.~\ref{fig: 1d_strand_geometry} as well as the external insulation layer (in red) and epoxy resin (in blue). The length of the considered domain is $L_\text{strand}=1~\text{m}$.
