In this section, 1D analysis of a single strand is conducted in ANSYS and COMSOL software. There are two cases considered: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1D strand analysis without insulation layer,
    \item 1D strand analysis with an external insulation layer.
\end{itemize}

For both cases, the mesh density study is conducted, too. In the given analyses, there are several assumptions made: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no helium cooling.
    \item Temperature in the winding's cross-sectional area is uniform.
    \item When the insulation layer is considered, the longitudinal heat transfer inside the insulation is negligible with respect to the transversal one.
\end{itemize}

The \nth{2} assumption allows one to consider this problem as a 1D longitudinal heat propagation. When the insulation layer is also simulated within the \nth{3} assumption, the analysis becomes a 1D+1D heat propagation problem. It will be further explained in the section \ref{subsection: 1D_quench_propagation_with_insulation}.
