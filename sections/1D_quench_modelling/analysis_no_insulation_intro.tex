This analysis presents the case for a bare strand, i.e. when neither insulation nor epoxy resin are considered. Therefore, the strand cross-sectional area is a yellow part of the domain presented in Fig. \ref{fig: 1d_strand_geometry}. The length of the considered domain is $L_\text{strand}=1~\text{m}$.
