At TE-MPE-PE section, the standard software to solve 1D heat propagation problems related to quench is COMSOL. In the \nth{1} step of the quench studies, simplified ANSYS models are verified by means of STEAM-BBQ being a tool implemented in COMSOL and developed in the section \cite{BBQ_manual}. The main aim of this cross-check is to verify the validity of implemented physics in ANSYS with respect to COMSOL. The presented studies are based on previously implemented 1D models in ANSYS where the influence of helium on the quench propagation is analysed~\cite{paudel_thesis}. A chapter of that work includes the comparison of COMSOL and ANSYS when an adiabatic 1D quench propagation is considered without an insulation layer~\cite{paudel_thesis} .
