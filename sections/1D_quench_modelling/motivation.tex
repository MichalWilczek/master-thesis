At TE-MPE-PE section, the standard software to solve thermal problems related to quench is COMSOL. Since the tool for quench velocity modelling was created in ANSYS, the \nth{1} step was to cross-check thermal quench analyses with a reference tool. Therefore, ANSYS was compared with STEAM-BBQ being a FEM-based tool implemented in COMSOL and developed in the section \cite{BBQ_manual}.

1D ANSYS simulations are also based on previously implemented 1D models in ANSYS where the influence of helium on the quench propagation was analysed. One of the chapters of that work included the comparison of COMSOL and ANSYS when an adiabatic 1D quench propagation is considered without insulation layer \cite{paudel_thesis}.
