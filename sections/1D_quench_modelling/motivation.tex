At TE-MPE-PE section, the standard software to solve 1D heat propagation problems related to quench is COMSOL. ANSYS, being one of the widespread tools for FEM-based analysis, has a well developed interface for creating multi-dimensional CAD geometries. It is an important asset for 3D analyses.
Therefore, the quench velocity modelling tool was created in ANSYS. The \nth{1} step was to cross-check thermal quench analyses with the reference tool. Therefore, ANSYS was compared with STEAM-BBQ being a tool implemented in COMSOL and developed in the section \cite{BBQ_manual}.

1D ANSYS simulations are also based on previously implemented 1D models in ANSYS where the influence of helium on the quench propagation was analysed. One of the chapters of that work included the comparison of COMSOL and ANSYS when an adiabatic 1D quench propagation is considered without an insulation layer \cite{paudel_thesis}.
