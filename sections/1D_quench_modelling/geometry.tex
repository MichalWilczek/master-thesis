In this thesis, all the simulations are based on the geometry of a skew quadrupole which belongs to the group of high-order corrector magnets designed for the upgrade of the High-Luminosity LHC. Skew quadrupole is developed by LASA laboratories of INFN-Milano. Its geometry is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Skew_quad_geometry}. Its two half-quadrants of two separate quadrants are positioned in one mechanical support. The entire magnet is placed inside the iron yoke.

Each quadrant of the magnet consists of 754 windings. The entire length of the coil equals 841~m. The 1D geometry is based on geometrical parameters of a single strand of a skew quadrupole whose simulations are further described in next section. As presented in Fig. \ref{fig: 1d_strand_geometry}, it consists of a strand with a circular cross-section (in yellow). It is made of Nb-Ti with copper as a stabiliser. The strand is fully insulated with an S2-glass material (in red). Then, it is immersed in D10 epoxy resin (in blue) \cite{hl_lhc_tech_design_report_v01}. In 1D analyses, the coil length is reduced to a 1 metre-long domain.

The parameters the skew quadrupole are presented in Table \ref{table:skew_quad_params_table}. None of the presented parameters does not change in any of further analyses presented in the thesis. Last two: $(i)$ residual resistivity ratio, RRR, $(ii)$ copper-to-superconductor ratio, $f_{Cu/Nb-Ti}$ come from a measured prototype of this magnet examined at INFN \cite{marco_prioli_mails}.
