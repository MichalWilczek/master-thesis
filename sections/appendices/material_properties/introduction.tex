The material properties used in this thesis are presented and discussed in the following Appendix. Since July 2019, it is recommended at TE-MPE-PE to use material fit functions provided by NIST. Except for the volumetric heat capacity of Nb-Ti, which NIST does not provide, all material properties are based on an update ROXIE\footnote{ROXIE is CERN internal software for electromagnetic simulation and optimisation of accelerator magnets.} database prepared at CERN \cite{material_properties_roxie}. Nb-Ti is defined based on CUDI being Arjan Verweij's CERN internal routine for modelling of superconducting strands and cables~\cite{cudi_manual}.
