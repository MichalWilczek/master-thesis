In the following Appendix, the material properties used in this thesis are presented and discussed. Since July 2019, it is recommended at TE-MPE-PE to use NIST functions related to all available material properties used in cryogenic studies. Except for the volumetric heat capacity of Nb-Ti, which is not available, all material properties are based on NIST taken from an update ROXIE\footnote{ROXIE is CERN internal software for electromagnetic simulation and optimisation of accelerator magnets.} database prepared at CERN \cite{material_properties_roxie}. Nb-Ti is defined based on CUDI being Arjan Verweij's CERN internal routine for modelling of superconducting strands and cables~\cite{cudi_manual}.
