As it was proven in Section~\ref{section: 1d_quench_propagation_modelling}, in order to solve a time-dependent temperature distribution over a 1D strand, a refined mesh with a decreased time step is required. This section aims at comparing the standard solution with a quench velocity-based methodology presented in Section~\ref{section:quench_velocity_modelling}. The quench velocity-based analyses are co-simulated with an external routine written in Python language, as described in Section~\ref{section:python_implementation} with implemented algorithms from Section~\ref{section:algorithms}.
