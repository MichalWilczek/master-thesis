The aim of this section is to compare the proposed quench velocity - based analysis with a standard heat balance equation modelling in ANSYS. The elements to compare are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item number of nodes,
    \item time step applied,
    \item relative error, 
    \item computing time.
\end{itemize}

The \nth{1} step is to conduct a heat balance equation - based analysis. It will serve for two purposes: ($i$) reference model for relative error, ($ii$) quench velocity value to be used in quench velocity - based model. The \nth{2} stage aims at conducting quench velocity - based simulations with quench velocity value obtained from 1D numerical heat balance equation - based models. 

In this section, all material properties are based on NIST standards described in Appendix \ref{appendix_material_properties_description}. The analysis is conducted for two cases separately: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1D strand analysis without insulation layer,
    \item 1D strand analysis with an external insulation layer.
\end{itemize}
