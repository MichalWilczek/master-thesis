The benchmark study is conducted for two cases separately: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1D strand analysis without insulation layer,
    \item 1D strand analysis with an external insulation layer.
\end{enumerate}

In order to conduct the analysis within the quench velocity-based approach, the value of quench velocity in time is required. The standard analysis serves for two purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item average quench velocity value to be used in the quench velocity-based model,
    \item reference model for a relative error.
\end{enumerate}

The benchmarking workflow, which compares the standard solution with a quench velocity-based method when no insulation is considered, is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:block_diagram_benchmarking_methodology_no_insulation}. As it is recommended in \cite[p.~40]{paudel_thesis}, the mesh should be discretised in the scale of a millimetre when an adiabatic quench thermal problem is considered. Therefore, the input mesh size of $x=1~\text{mm}$ was set as the input parameter with a relatively large time step range of $t= [100, 1000]~\upmu \text{s}$. The workflow is divided into three main parts: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item find the time step range,
    \item find the mesh size, 
    \item test quench velocity-based method with varying input parameters.
\end{enumerate}

The first two parts of the workflow are an iteration loop with a condition statement of a relative error with respect to an average quench velocity. The relative error range is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
    E_\text{r} = \frac{r_\text{i}-r_{i-1}}{r_\text{i}}~100\%,
\end{equation}
where $r_\text{i}$ -- reference analysis, $r_{i-1}$ -- analysis from the preceding iteration loop~$i$. In all the analyses, the condition statement imposes an absolute value of a relative error less or equal to 1\%. In this chapter, the quench velocity is calculated in a different manner with respect to Chapter \ref{chapter: 1d_quench_propagation_modelling} where the method was imposed by the STEAM-BBQ tool. The average quench velocity is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    v_\text{quench} = \frac{ \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \frac{x_{j+1}-x_j}{\Delta t} }{k},
\end{equation}
where $x_j$ -- quench front position at time window~$j$, $\Delta t$ -- time increment between two time windows $j$ and $j+1$, $k$ -- number of time windows $j$. The time increment for the standard analyses was assumed to be equal to $\Delta t=10~\text{ms}$. In addition, all material properties are based on fits provided by NIST described in Appendix~\ref{appendix_material_properties_description}.

The next step of the benchmarking is the comparison conducted with an external insulation layer. The method workflow is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:block_diagram_benchmarking_methodology_with_insulation}. In this case, the longitudinal mesh size as well as a time step range are taken from a reference model without the insulation layer. In the standard analysis, one searches for a mesh size across the insulation layer which allows for obtaining the solution within the precision of a relative error of 1\% with respect to the average quench velocity. When the condition statement of a relative error is fulfilled, the average quench velocity is taken from a reference model and set as an input parameter in the quench velocity-based approach.
