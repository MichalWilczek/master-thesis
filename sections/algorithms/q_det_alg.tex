When a multi-strand thermal quench problem is analysed, a quenched zone belonging to one winding heats up the neighbouring ones across the insulation layer. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: quench_propagation_heat_flux} the heat flux $\vec{\phi_\text{q}}$ is directed towards the non-quenched neighbouring windings placed outside of a~red, dashed circumference. Therefore, in order to account for the transverse quench propagation, it is required to create an algorithm that detects the temperature above the~critical temperature, $T_\text{c}$ in windings where the~quench has not occurred, yet. In detail, the~algorithm detects quenches and initiates a new quench front propagation when the~temperature outside of the~quenched zone exceeds the~critical temperature of a superconductor. In other words, it is responsible for a turn-to-turn propagation across the~insulation layer between different windings.
