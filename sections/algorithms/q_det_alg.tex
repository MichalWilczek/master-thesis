In this section, an algorithm detecting new quenches in a multi-strand domain is presented. It is only valid when a multi-filament geometry is analysed when a quenched winding heats up the neighbouring ones across the insulation layer. In detail, the algorithm detects quenches and initiates a new quench front propagation  when the temperature outside of the quenched zone exceeds the critical temperature of a superconductor. It is responsible for turn-to-turn propagation across the insulation layer between windings.

Provided that searching starts at node $N$, winding number is $W$, magnetic field strength of the winding $W$ is $B_W$, node temperature is $T_N$ and critical temperature of related winding is $T_{c,W}$, the problem is solved as described in Algorithm \ref{alg:quench_detection}.
